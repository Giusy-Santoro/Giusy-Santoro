  <p>
I am a student at Epicode, a training program for web front-end developers. I am passionate about technology and photography.

My goal is to become a skilled and creative web front-end developer. I am interested in working at a company that will allow me to use my skills to create innovative and useful products.

I have learned the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap. I have also learned to use React, a JavaScript framework for creating dynamic web user interfaces.

In my GitHub repository, you can find the exams I took during the course, as well as some personal projects I have worked on. These projects have allowed me to solidify my knowledge and test my creativity.
